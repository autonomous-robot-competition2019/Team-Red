## Week 9 Notebook

At the beginning of this week our focus was on determining the problem with our color identification in our pixycam and solving that issue so we
could continue to work on other aspects of the robot. We continued trouble shooting with our original pixycam but were still having difficulty maintaining
consistency in the quality of our signatures as well as differentiating between green and yellow. After I long period of trial and error we decided it would be 
best to switch to a new pixy cam and see if that alleviated the problem. We also decided to test with red quaffles instead of green due to the fact the similarity 
between the green and yellow was causing us so much trouble. After installing the new pixy cam and elevating the position of the mount we were able to track quaffles 
much more consistently than we had been before. Despite this improvement there are still some blind spots where the robot will lose the ball and become unable
to continue its tracking. We will have to address these issues before the competition to ensure a ball can always be located.


Next, we chose to attempt to build a plow at the front of the robot in order to move unwanted quaffles out of the way so that the robot doesn't get stuck on
them while it is attempting to move around the around the arena. To achieve this we attached another lego arm to the side of the robot and built a foam core plow that
we hoped would push quafffles out of the way as it moved. We used the code for the first arm we created to raise and lower this new arm with the plow attached at
the end. The arm worked perfectly and after a small amount of tweaking we had a second functional arm with the plow attached. The foam core plow we built however was not as successful, 
it was unable to move the quaffles when it encountered them, and the balls pushed their way under the barrier as it moved. We plan to make a new plow maybe with a stronger material
in order to make this tool more functional. We will also have to add code into our main sketch which will control when the second arm will be raised and lowered.



### Goals for next week:
- Increase consistency of pixycam tracking
- Create a functional plow
- implement the keeper role
