# Wesley Olstad's Notebook

These are the weekly entries for Wesley Olstad's individual notebook.

## Week of February 11th

This is the first week we really had an opportunity to have some time to independently work on and design our robot. We discussed some general design ideas for the robot, but realized we should focus on reaching the simple milestones before we decide on a complicated design. We decided to make a basic frame out of legos we can use to test locomotion, sensors, and basic P&A loops for the milestones. Currently, we have the basic frame completed and have two servo motors attached for movement. Our next step will be to mount the Arduino and Adafruit servo shield so we can create a robot that moves forward for the first milestone.

We also spent some time playing with the servo shield and motors. None of us have any Arduino experience, so it took quite a while but we managed to run some example code with the servo shield and motors. I am currently researching the servo shield to better understand how to control the motors for locomotion. I am currently not completely sure how it works, but I think I am closer to understanding. The following resources have been helpful for me so far:

Hopefully, on Monday we will have a robot that moves and can work on using the Pixycam to allow the robot to interact with the world.
