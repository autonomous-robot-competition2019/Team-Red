## Week of Febuary 11th

This week we started the constuction of a chassis for our robot in order to get a solid base model to work off of.
Utilizing lego bricks we were able to make a main body for the robot that houses two servo motors which will eventually be used for movement. Next week we plan to implement wheels into the design and code working movement within arduino to tackle our first milestone. Our current plan is to address the basic milestones first and then naturally progress into the more challenging tasks as our design evolves over time. To achieve movement we will have to write code to allow the servo shield to control our two motors and turn the wheels.
It seems like we will have to calibrate the servos and understand their range before we will be able to code their desired effect on the motors. We are currently doing research on the adafruit servo shield to better understand how it functions when combined with the motors in our design.
