# Week 10 Journal

This week, we mainly focused on adding the final physical parts to the robot and calibrating it to the new color of quaffle. The first issue we encountered was that if the robot encountered other quaffles, it would run them over and get stuck. To fix this issue, we assembled a "plow" out of foam core to allow the robot to move more easily without getting stuck on objects.

We initially wanted the plow to move up and down with a servo motor so that it wouldn't interfere with the claw, but this proved to be quite difficult. The mechanism we created added too much weight and was unstable. We decided to move the pixycam and the IR sensor on our robot so that we could mount the plow in a fixed position. This proved to be successful.

We then calibrated the robot to the new color quaffle. However, after adding the plow, the additional weight caused the robot to be unstable and its tracking failed. We plan to remove some of the complications from our drive function so that the robot can better locate objects. We also are thinking to use the light sensor instead of the distance sensor to determine whether or not the robot has arrived at the goal.
